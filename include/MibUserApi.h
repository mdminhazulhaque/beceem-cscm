Description: 
The PHSM is an 8-bit mask that indicates which bytes in the PHS Field (PHSF) to suppress and which bytes to not suppress. 
The PHSM allows fields, such as sequence numbers or checksums (which vary in value), to be excluded from suppression 
with the constant bytes around them suppressed It is encoded as follows: 
bit 0: 0 = don't suppress the 1st byte of the suppression field 1 = suppress first byte of the suppression field bit 1: 0 = don't suppress the 2nd byte of the 
suppression field 1 = suppress second byte of the suppression field bit x: 0 = don't suppress the (x+1) byte of the 
suppression field 1 = suppress (x+1) byte of the suppression field where the length of the octet string is 
ceiling (wmanIfCmnPhsRulePhsSize/8)
